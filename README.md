# Game Layout

1. A project for a two player fully working chess game using letters and numbers to move the pieces to represent the pieces (both the uppercase and lowercase):

White pieces representation:
- P: pawn
- Q: queen
- K: king
- N: knight
- R: rook
- B: bishop

Black pieces representation:
- p: pawn
- q: queen
- k: king
- n: knight
- r: rook 
- b: bishop

2. The game itself can be played against a bot as well

# Game Controls

You can move the pieces on the board using the current position of the piece and the position you want to move it to
For example:
Assuming that we are at the starting position and you are white, you want to move your pawn up so you can do: e2e4
Let's analyze the string "e2e4" for a bit, "e2" here represents the current position of the piece that you want to 
move (in this case the piece in that position is the white pawn),and "e4" on the otherhand is the position that you 
want to move that piece to.
